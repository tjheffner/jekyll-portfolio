This post will eventually be a walkthrough of actually building the <a href='/projects/meat-smoker.html'>damn thing</a>.

## Supplies:

| __Item__      | __Quantity__ |  __Comment__                                                                        |
| ------------- |:------------:| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Cabinet  | 1            |  As many drawers as you like, mine has 4.                                           |
| Metal Grate   | 3            |  1 less than the # of drawers. Don't get galvanized steel, it's unsafe for cooking. |
| Thermometer   | 3            |  One for each drawer with a grate. Grill thermometers work great.                   |
| Nut & Washer  | 3 pair       |  To secure thermometer to drawer. Came included with the thermometers I bought.     |
| Floor Vent    | 1-2          |  Adjustable vents to help regulate airflow + smoke output. Back vent optional.      |
| Spraypaint    | 3 cans       |  I used heat-resistant flat black grill paint. Totally optional.                    |
| Tools         | --           |  Powerdrill, wire snips, and a sawzall. Used to cut holes for grates & vents.       |

Choosing a file cabinet is an important part. I recycled mine from a [local recycling center](the rebuilding center). I wanted to find one that was a little older, because newer file cabinets use plastic parts on the drawer-pull mechanisms. That I really wasn't trying to disassemble every cabinet drawer to replace some plastic washers with metal ones, so that the drawers still work and I can safely consume food cooked in the cabinet, without fear of toxic fumes from heated plastic. Older ones have their own fun, in that many have lead-based paint and there's not a good way to tell. So the paint has to go.

* I ordered the thermometers from Amazon, I think they were around $4 each. 
* Home Depot sold the perfect size grill grates, small enough to fit in the drawer, big enough to have sufficient cooking area exposed to smoke. 
* Home Depot also sold the paint.
* And the floor vents. and the tools.

## Prep
Decide how you want your smoker to function. My cabinet has 4 drawers, and is set up for the bottom box to be a firebox, the second lowest drawer has my water / drip container, and the top two drawers are for food. I usually keep my veggies in the top drawer, so that meat doesn't drip onto them. 

You also need to determine how you want your firebox to function. It can be as simple as starting a fire in the drawer (what I've chosen to do) or, if you want more temperature control, by using a gas burner or electric stove. You would then need to connect the hose to the propane tank or wire to an outlet.

## Steps
1. Cut a hole in the box.
2. But seriously, we're gonna measure some things first. My file cabinet needs 8 holes total, some much larger than others.
  * 1 hole in the very top, for smoke to get out. We're going to put a floor vent here.
  * 1 large hole in every drawer bottom that isn't the firebox, for the grates to cover.
  * 1 small hole on the front face of each of the drawers that you just cut large holes in.
    - my file cabinet drawers had a weird knob below the handles, I just took those off and put the thermometers there. You may need to drill a hole.
  * 1 hole in the back, towards the bottom, so the fire can breathe. The other floor vent (if you bought it) goes here.
3. Measure those holes.
4. Cut the holes.
  - To cut each hole, there was a bit of a process:
  * First, take a powerdrill with a decent size bit, and make two or three holes next to each other, through the file cabinet metal. 
  * Then, take the wire snips to connect those holes and snip away until you have an opening that is large enough to safely fit & start the sawzall blade in.
  * Sawzall down the length of the hole side.
  * Repeat as needed for other sides.
  * Wiresnip away any rough/dangerous edges.
5. After the holes are cut, put all the grates & thermometers and vents in.
6. Now, we discover fire.
  * For this first fire, I just wanted to see if things would burn, temperatures would rise, smoke would travel through drawers, etc. etc. Testing. This is where I found I needed to remove the vent on the bottom entirely for enough air to reach the fire.
  * Adjust hole sizes / vent openings / amount of wood on the fire / etc until you're satisfied with test results.
7. Time to get rid of all the inside paint! We don't want that on our food. Spoiler: we're going to light more fires.
  * I brushed _everything_ inside the cabinet with some olive oil. The cabinet walls, the drawer walls, all of it. 
  * Then, I easily tripled the amount of wood I put in the cabinet for the first fire. This fire is the hottest my smoker has burned, because I filled _every_ drawer with wood and kindling, to make sure that enough heat & smoke hit the paint anywhere it was.
  * When this fire died out, almost all of the paint had either burnt off or easily peeled away in large, crisp, flakes. For the patches that didn't, I sanded them out with lots of sandpaper.
  * Sandpapering was hard work, and the drawers had lots of weird crinkles I couldn't sand, so I stopped doing that and decided I wanted to get on with it.
  * One more test fire, smaller this time, just to clear everything out & give our newly exposed metal insides a nice smoky coating.
8. Paint the outside!
  * Remove your thermometers. I originally took the top vent out but having the different colors looked pretty goofy, so I painted it too.
  * I needed just under 3 cans to evenly coat a 4-drawer file cabinet.
9. Cook!
