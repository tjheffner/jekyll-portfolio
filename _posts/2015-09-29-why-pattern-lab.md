## Prototyping

No matter what your developmental choices are, be they oriented for Drupal, Wordpress, Ruby, or any of the other myriad possibilities available to developers in 2015-- at the end of the day, what you see on the web boils down to HTML.

If we keep this simple fact in mind, the power of prototyping, particularly with Pattern Lab, quickly becomes clear.

First, what do we mean by prototyping?

**"Simple, rapid, iterative generation of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and other assets expressly for the purpose of informing - and consumption by - builds in more complex systems."**

The rapid, iterative generation of assets provides developers(/designers/teams/clients) with some enormous benefits. Pixel-perfect design comps rarely, if ever, translate exactly to the web. They are a wonderful starting point, but with the multitude of screen sizes available to users today, it's practically impossible to match the comps entirely. That's where iteration comes in-- quickly see what works and what doesn't, across all aspects of the design.

* Solve problems early, before complex backend dev
* Test UX early with real code
* Easily updateable designs
* Shared design vocabulary
* Front-end development is FAST
* Generate assets (CSS/JS/Icons) at STEP ONE
* Parallel development with "back-end"
* Roadmap for back-end development

All of those are important, but those last two are truly invaluable. Many current workflows have a division between front and back-end devs. Front end development can't truly begin until the complex backend structure is built and generating the html that needs to be stylized. Prototyping turns that division into a true partnership-- front-end developers can quickly generate simple HTML representations with real CSS. While the back-end is being constructed, there are visible guidelines for what structures are needed and which classes need applied where. By following those guides, the CSS from the prototype is the exact same as the CSS for the actual production site.

With all of that in mind, let's talk about Pattern Lab.

## Prototyping with Pattern Lab

Pattern Lab is [in my opinion] the ideal tool for front-end web development in 2015. It's really a collection of tools, including a living style guide, a component library, a viewport resizer for easy testing among a variety of screen sizes, annotations, and an auto refresh tool. All of which combine to streamline front-end development.

* Implements Atomic Design at a code level
* Produces HTML and assets like CSS and JS
* Works locally, generates static, hostable code
* A full interface to navigate all prototypes
* Responsive tools built in [viewport resizer]
* Is un-opinionated about *how* those assets are written:
	* BEM, SMACSS, Sass/Less
	* Task runners: Grunt, Gulpâ€‹

The un-opinionated nature of Pattern Lab makes it trivial to add to your current workflow-- no need to learn new styles of writing code, Pattern Lab handles them all just the same.



 

## But really, why?
I think the Pattern Lab website explains it best:
