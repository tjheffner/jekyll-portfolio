*** TO DO ***
- reorder projects on homepage [can't randomize bc github pages doesn't allow custom plugins]
- epifoodus, but not until things are fixed
  -- possible reboot/refactoring
      -- needs to be reworked into something other than php/postgres, jekyll can't support PHP
- additional blog post explaining construction
- update about page
- blog posts whenever~! about anything~!
- tweak styling here and there
