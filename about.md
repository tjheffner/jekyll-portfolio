Hello, welcome, thanks for being here.

Pardon the dust, this site is perpetually under construction.

My name is Tanner Heffner and I live in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2014, where I received a B.S. in Journalism: Advertising, with a minor in Multimedia Art.
After that, I attended a four-month vocational program for web development called Epicodus. Currently I'm employed as a developer at <a href="http://www.phase2technology.com" target="_blank">Phase2</a>, where I work mostly on the front-end of Drupal sites, but not always.

 
When I'm not developing for work, sometimes I'm doing it for fun. In no particular order, I'm also interested in: climbing, hiking, basketball, art, DIY, sustainability, the intersection of art and technology, social media, good Mexican food, books, cooking, happy hour, life, the universe, and everything, etc.

I'm unable to share most client-work publicly in a timely manner, so nearly everything on this website is personal projects or past student work.
If you would like to see what I've done professionally, are interested in collaborating, or just want to chat, please <a href='/connect/'>drop me a line.</a>
