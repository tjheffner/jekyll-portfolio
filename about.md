Hello, welcome, thanks for being here.

Pardon the dust, this site is perpetually under construction.

My name is Tanner and I live in Portland, Oregon. I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2014, where I received a B.S. in Journalism: Advertising, with a minor in Multimedia Art. <br>

After that, I attended a four-month vocational program for web development called Epicodus. Currently I'm employed as a developer at <a href="http://www.phase2technology.com" target="_blank">Phase2</a>, where I work mostly on the front-end of Drupal sites, but not always.

 
When I'm not developing for work, sometimes I'm doing it for fun. Some other things that interest me include: <br>
<span class="spacer">
 climbing, <br>
 hiking, <br>
 basketball,  <br>
 art, <br>
 DIY, <br>
 sustainability,  <br>
 the intersection of art and technology, <br>
 social media, <br>
 good Mexican food, <br>
 books, <br>
 cooking, <br>
 happy hour, <br>
 life, <br>
 the universe,  <br> 
 and everything,  <br>
 etc.  <br>
</span>

I'm unable to share most client-work publicly in a timely manner, so nearly everything on this website is a personal project.
If you would like to see work I've done professionally, are interested in collaborating, or just want to chat, please <a href='/connect/'>drop me a line.</a>
