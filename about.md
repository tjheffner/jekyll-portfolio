hello, welcome, thanks for being here.

name's tanner. i live in portland, oregon. currently i'm employed as a developer at phase 2, where i work mostly on the front-end of drupal sites, but not always.

this site is a collection of personal & student projects i enjoyed creating and should probably be updated far more often than it is.

for questions/inquiries feel free to contact me through email or twitter
