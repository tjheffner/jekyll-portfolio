Hello, welcome, thanks for being here.

Pardon the dust, this website is perpetually under construction. You can view the particulars of its <a href="https://github.com/tjheffner/tjheffner.github.io" target="_blank" __>current mess here</a>.

My name is Tanner and I live in Portland, Oregon. Currently I'm employed as a developer at <a href="http://www.phase2technology.com" target="_blank" __>Phase2</a>, where I work mostly on the front-end of Drupal sites, but not always.

When I'm not developing for work, sometimes I'm doing it for fun. Some other interests include: <br>
<ul class="stuff">
 <li>basketball, </li><br>
 <li>climbing, </li><br>
 <li>hiking, </li><br>
 <li>DIY, </li><br>
 <li>sustainability, </li><br>
 <li>the intersection of art and technology, </li><br>
 <li>social media, </li><br>
 <li>good Mexican food, </li><br>
 <li>happy hour, </li><br>
 <li>life, </li><br>
 <li>the universe, </li><br>
 <li>everything. </li><br>
</ul>

If you would like to see work I've done professionally, are interested in collaborating, or just want to chat, please <a href='/connect/'>drop me a line.</a>
