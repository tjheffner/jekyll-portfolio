At Epicodus, one of our weekly tests was to design a web-app that would return the type of triangle based on three input values.
Simple enough, but I wanted to actually _see_ the triangle, not just its supposed type. So I wrote a little bit extra. The triangle,
if it exists, is also drawn using jQuery and SVG polygons. Turns out, my 9th-grade algebra teacher was right--- it did come in handy someday!
