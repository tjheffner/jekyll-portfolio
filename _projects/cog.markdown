Brief via <a href="http://www.futurelions.com/" target="_blank">Future Lions</a>: Connect an audience of your choosing to a product or service from a global brand in a way that wasnâ€™t possible five years ago.

As far as things "that weren't possible five years ago" go, you can't get much newer than Google Glass. The problem is, Google Glass currently seems like a very selfish product-- very "me! me! me! look at me! I have a fancy computer on my face!"

It could be, and should be, so much more. It has the technology. So we decided to connect that fancy face machine to an audience that would truly benefit-- people affected by early stages of dementia.
