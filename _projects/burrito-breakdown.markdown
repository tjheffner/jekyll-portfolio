**Brief:** Wrap up Eugene's burrito culture and roll out various multimedia components on tight deadlines.


I'll always remember fall term senior year as the time when I was tasked with finding the best burrito spot in Eugene. For a grade.

Ask thirty people what their favorite place to get a burrito in town is, youâ€™re likely to get thirty different answers. Who would have guessed there were this many burrito joints in Eugene?

After narrowing it down to the 16 most-relevant options for Oregon students, particularly concerning distance from university neighborhoods (& considering my timeframe/college budget), the challenge was on.

Burritos are not complicated, and neither was the judging.
Entries were judged on three categories, each on a scale of 1-5:

    Taste:
      Does it taste good?
    Size:
      I'm hungry.
    Price:
      Are you getting your money's worth?

Highest total score claims the title of **"Eugene's Best Burrito"**
Simple. And delicious.

_A fourth category, **Atmosphere/Service** was used for tiebreaks, as it is the least relevant to your burrito experience._
