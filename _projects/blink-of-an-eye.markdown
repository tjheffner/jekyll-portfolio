**Challenge:** How do you design an interactive visualization that captivates from one data point to over two billion?

I graduated in the summer of 2014. It felt like my college experience went by in the blink of an eye.

How long is a blink? _(330 milliseconds)_

How many blinks was college really? _(approximately 2,096,639,997 blinks, give or take a few)_

Why did they go so fast? _(don't say time flies when you're having fun don't say time flies when you're_

Each trail spawned represents one 'blink,' and new blinks spawn every 330ms.
