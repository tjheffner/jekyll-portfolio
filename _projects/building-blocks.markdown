For a digital art class, we had to pitch our professor three potential projects, purely using Photoshop.
My ideal choice was to create some animated sports moments, in the vein of [Pat Ruby](http://patruby.com/animations){:target="_blank"},
but my professor was intrigued by what I meant by "isometric pixel art" and wanted to see an example.

What resulted were some of the University of Oregon's most iconic bricks and blocks, built from the humble pixel.
