John Cage wrote several sonatas based on the placement of stars in the sky.
He used sections of starcharts to transpose the locations of certain stars to their equivalent on
a music staff. My idea for this project is similar--- taking a random image of stars to play a note
corresponding to the individual locations (and brightness) of stars on screen.
Originally built using Processing, later ported to the web with p5.js.
