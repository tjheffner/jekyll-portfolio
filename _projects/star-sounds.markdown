John Cage wrote several sonatas based on the placement of stars in the sky.
He used sections of starcharts to transpose the locations of certain stars to their equivalent on
a music staff. My idea for this project is similar--- taking a random image of stars to play a note
corresponding to the individual locations (and brightness) of stars on screen.
Originally built using Processing, later ported to the web with p5.js.

<a href="{{ site.url }}/starsounds" target="_blank">Make your own music from the stars here!</a>

<br>
Hit any key to reveal some stars. Click a star to play a note. Hit any key to play a different space.
If no sound plays, try using a different browser. Firefox seems to work best, chrome seems to have issues with p5.sound.js.
